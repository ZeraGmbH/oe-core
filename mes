    mesa: disable LLVM on x86
    
    Whilst turning on the LLVM drivers is a honourable goal, the performance impact
    is *huge*.  Instead let specific BSPs turn it on as required.

    mesa: Disble TLS for musl
    
    See https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35268
    mesa should infact stop using __attribute__((tls_model("initial-exec")))
    until then we disale TLS in glx for musl
    The problem could happen even on glibc if static TLS sizes are large enough
    which would mean that additional space the glibc leaves for such rogue libraries
    get consumed and then same problems show up there as well
    
    Fixes errors seen in xorg logs e.g.
    
    (EE) Failed to load /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so: Error relocating /usr/lib/libGL.so.1: _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable: initial-exec TLS resolves to dynamic definition in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1
    
    enable readonly text segment on x86 for musl

    mesa: Fix build with wayland and egl
    
    When wayland and egl both are on then it enables the wayland
    plugin which actually fails to build because its not finding wayland-protocol
    xml templates in proper location which is recipe sysroot since
    we are cross compiling
    
    Fixes build errors e.g.
    make[4]: *** No rule to make target `//usr/share/wayland-protocols/unstable/linux-dmabuf/linux-dmabuf-unstable-v1.xml', needed by `drivers/dri2/linux-dmabuf-unstable-v1-client-protocol.h'.  Stop.
